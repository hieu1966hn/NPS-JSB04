                </h3>
                <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the
                United States. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great 
                family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.
                </p>
                <p>Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, 
                sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. 
                They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility and 
                competitive obedience.</p>
                <p>These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home 
                or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you 
                want a loyal, loving, and smart companion, consider adopting one of these pups 
                into your pack.</p>
